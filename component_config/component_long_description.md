This connector downloads files from [Microsoft OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage) and stores them in your project.

The Microsoft OneDrive cloud storage integrates the [Office365](https://www.office.com/) and [SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration) sites. It also supports SharePoint's document libraries. This connector lets you access all your files in your personal or business account.

With the flexibility of file path masks, you can now download multiple files within a single configuration. Additionally, you can selectively download only the files that have been updated.
